(ambient music)
- On August 5th, 1993,
seven hikers set out
to the Khamar-Daban Mountain range.
All but one would make it out alive.
Yet to this day,
the circumstances
surrounding this incident
remain as one of the strangest
mysteries in history.
What happened on this
mountain, where is everyone,
and why is the Khamar-Daban incident
so incredibly unsettling?
Tonight's video is sponsored by,
I'm just kidding. (chuckles)
Guys, I am so excited.
Today is the day where I
get to show you something
that I have been working on for months.
Welcome to "Late Nights with
Nexpo," my brand new podcast
that launches today on
all podcast platforms
with new episodes
dropping not every month,
not every two months,
but every single week.
To celebrate the occasion,
myself, with the help of
my team at Ballen Studios,
have gone ahead and
animated this launch episode
to give you something to chew on tonight.
So if you end up liking it,
let me know in the comments
and we may end up doing
more of these in the future.
Before we get started, think
of these like campfire stories,
something to throw on
and let your mind escape.
For a while now, I've been
wanting to bring you guys
something more casual, less intensive,
and more frequent while I crack
away at the big boy uploads.
And I think bringing you
guys podcast episodes
every single week is the
perfect way to do that.
Before we get started, I'd like to stress
that none of anything about this podcast
replaces anything that you
know and love about my channel.
This is merely something
extra for you guys to chew on.
Without further ado, welcome, my friends,
to "Late Nights with Nexpo."
(dramatic music)
Siberia.
August, 1993.
The river is freezing cold,
snow melts from the
Khamar-Daban mountain range,
which looms overhead.
Your kayak cuts through the water.
You take in the fresh mountain
air and the rugged landscape.
It's a long overdue escape from the city.
Out here, the only signs of civilization
are power lines running
over the mountains,
which aren't easy enough to ignore.
(ambient music)
But out of nowhere,
something catches your eye
and the peaceful atmosphere dissolves.
There's someone standing on
the far shore of the river,
framed starling against the trees.
It's a teenage girl.
She's waving her arms frantically,
screaming for you to stop.
From this distance, you
can't quite make it out,
but it looks almost like her
jacket is stained with blood.
You don't hesitate.
You dive into the frigid
water and swim to shore.
And when you reach the girl,
she collapses into your arms.
She's delirious, inconsolable.
You can barely make out
half of what she's saying
through her psalms.
She says she's scared
that she's all alone.
You wonder why this girl's
out in the wild by herself,
but what she says next
answers your question
and makes your blood run
as cold as the river.
Everyone else is dead.
(ambient music)
A week earlier, August 2nd, 1993.
Two hiking groups from
Kazakhstan climb up a steep trail
away from the nearest town.
They're heading into the
wilds of Southern Siberia's
Khamar-Daban Mountain Range.
They're a school-sponsored
hiking expedition
mostly in their teens and early 20s.
One group is led by a man
named Konstantin Kazantsev.
The other is led by Lyudmila Korovina,
an experienced hiker who has
traveled these mountains before
and who also happens to be the mother
of one of Konstantin's student hikers.
Lyudmila's group will be
taking a high altitude route
across the mountain range
before descending back
down towards civilization.
On the map, the route follows a rough arc
across the mountains
and back to a small lake
called Lake Tavatuy.
They have two tents
and will camp along
the 40-kilometer route.
While Lyudmila's group takes the summit,
Konstantin will guide his group
along a lower altitude valley
route, following the river.
Despite the lower elevation,
Konstantin's group's route
is technically the more
difficult of the two.
The difficulty of the
Russian alpine routes
are measured on a scale of one to six,
with one being a beginner slope
and six being near vertical,
only to be attempted by experts.
Lyudmila's route is rated a three,
which makes it a
moderately difficult slope
around 35 to 45 degrees in IC.
This requires confidence and sure footing,
but it's not a grain that
requires special equipment.
Konstantin's route, by
comparison, is a four,
which usually indicates
some steep rocky sections
at an incline of more than 55 degrees.
The plan is for the two groups to begin
and end the multi-day hike together
with several days in between
in which the two groups will separate
and hike their respective routes.
So when the trail forks,
the valley group will take the low road,
the summit group will take the high road.
And on August 5th, they'll meet back up
at the designated lake.
While it's still summer,
weather up in the mountains
can be fickle in Siberia
with snowfall beginning
as early as late August.
Anticipating this,
Lyudmila contacted local
weather monitoring stations
ahead of time.
They told her the worst she could expect
is a mild chance of wind and rain,
nothing to be too concerned about.
Well, except for this.
They were given a stark cryptic warning
as they departed a nearby
town for the mountains.
One of the locals urged
the hikers to be careful
as wildlife in the area was
behaving strangely aggressively.
No one could explain why,
but something in the mountains
was driving animals insane.
And most recently,
bears in the area had been
witnessed throwing themselves
in front of trains.
Lyudmila and Konstantin's groups
arrive at the fork in the trail.
Lyudmila does a quick
headcount of her six students.
Sacha, Denis, Timur, Viktoriya,
Tatiana, and Valentina.
They're all here, all ready to go.
The groups say goodbye
for now and part ways.
Following her map,
Lyudmila guides our
summit group along a river
through a nearby pass.
Before long, their group is
walking uphill at a steady pace
through the trees and into the mountains.
So far, the weather is favorable.
Warm summer air.
Lyudmila's relieved
that the weather forecast remains accurate
as there are some inexperienced
hikers in her group.
Lyudmila, aware that her group
must keep up their strength,
insists that they eat four times a day,
including snacks during rest stops.
She knows that some people think of her
as hardened survivalist drill
sergeant for her students,
pushing them to their
limits, but in her own mind,
the safety of her hikers is
always her first concern.
(somber music)
They're making good time
and are able to summit the
first ridge ahead of schedule.
Even the least experienced hikers,
the 24-year-old Tatiana and
the 16-year-old Viktoriya,
managed to keep up.
For both of them, it's their
first grade three hike,
a major milestone of any
aspiring mountaineer.
For now, the summit group is riding high,
but they know a lot more terrain
awaits them over the coming days
and something else awaits them,
something they can't possibly know about
because they're miles from
any remaining civilization.
The winds and weather
forecasts for Khamar-Daban
are shifting and it's clear
and it's for the worse.
August 4th, two days into the hike,
Lyudmila's early
confidence starts to wane.
The group reaches a treeless alpine zone.
And here, their fortunes turn.
The weather sours,
heavy rain and wind whips and
tears at the seven hikers.
Visibility is poor and the
temperature is dropping rapidly.
Their progress slows to a crawl.
Lyudmila clutches onto
her map like a lifeline,
making sure that they
stay on the proper path.
One of the worst things that
can happen in these conditions
is to stray off course and get lost.
Lyudmila knows
her students won't make
the ridge before nightfall,
and so she barks orders
through the raging wind,
instructing the group to make camp.
The students spring to action
and begin setting up their
tents in an open flat area,
about two miles above the tree line.
It's exposed, but Lyudmila reasons
that they had better play it
safe and not push themselves.
She urges her students to
forage before it gets too dark.
Keeping their strength up is important
and there's no telling how
long they're gonna need
to wait out the storm.
The group manages to find deposits
of golden root in the area
and they hurriedly gather
as much as they can.
It's rich in minerals and nutrients,
a perfect supplement to
their cache of supplies.
Once camp is set up,
they cluster into two tents for the night.
One for the boys and one for the girls.
Lyudmila honkers down
with Tatiana, Viktoriya, and Valentina,
trying their best to stay warm.
Outside, the temperature plummets
and the rain turns to snow.
Lyudmila does her best not to
show it, but she's concerned.
This isn't where they were
supposed to camp for the night.
It's too exposed.
Also, for days, she's been
growing increasingly concerned
that her map of the area is inaccurate.
(ambient music)
At the summit known as Titran's Peak,
there would be a sturdy
structure and firewood
waiting for them,
but Lyudmila can't tell
how close they are to it.
She decides that it isn't worth the gamble
to try and reach a wooden structure
that may or may not actually
be where her map claims it is.
As of now, the students are shivering,
but otherwise seem in good spirits.
Lyudmila's concern is growing.
If the storm goes on for much longer,
things could turn sour very, very quickly.
But even still, she puts on a
brave face for her students.
She's been on worse hikes than
this and they all know it.
It's her confidence and experience
that gives courage to even
the least experienced hiker,
even if it's all for show.
Meanwhile, far below,
Konstantin's valley group
is having a perfectly pleasant time.
At their lower elevation,
there's no wind or snow,
and they all get a restful night's sleep
in relative comfort.
On August 5th,
they arrive at Lake
Tavatuy right on schedule.
The small lake is the
agreed upon rendezvous point
where Konstantin's valley group
and Lyudmila's summit group
are to link back up.
But there was no sign of the summit group
when Konstantin arrives.
So he tells his students
to unshoulder their packs
and to relax a while.
They can wait.
One of the members of this
party is Natalia Korovina,
Lyudmila's 16-year-old daughter.
She takes off her backpack
and helps the others set up their tents.
She isn't concerned about
her mother's tardiness.
She understands better than anyone
that Lyudmila is a cautious person.
Plus, the summit group has
several inexperienced teenagers.
She'd wanna make sure her
group is safe before moving on.
When they're finished
setting up the tents,
she starts to wander along the lake shore,
looking up at the Khamar-Daban Mountains.
From the lake, she
doesn't have a direct view
of where her mother would be,
but she notices something strange
about the trees in the distance.
They aren't standing upright,
but are at an angle like
they've been smoothed over
by an enormous comb.
Combined with some scattered
clouds around the peaks,
she assumes that means there
are pockets of bad weather
at the high altitude.
Lyudmila and her students
might be getting some rain
and wind, which is concerning,
but nothing she hasn't handled before.
Suddenly, however, Natalia
stops in her tracks.
A set of eyes are staring out at her
from the foliage nearby, unblinking.
It's a moose.
Natalia's mouth falls open
and she wants to call the
other hikers, but she doesn't.
Mooses always steer clear of hikers,
but for some reason, this
one isn't intimidated
by their presence at all.
In fact, there's an almost
aggressive air to its posture.
It's an unsettling encounter,
and that's when she remembers
what the people in town told her
about the bears in the area.
Something isn't right and
the animals can feel it.
Slowly, she backs away.
The moose boldly stands its ground.
Natalia returns to her group
and tries to put the
moose out of her mind.
She reminds herself
that animals sometimes behave
strangely just like people do.
She'll have to remember to
tell her mother about this.
(somber music)
A day passes, then another.
The mood begins to shift
and concern sets in.
There's a chance that the summit group
isn't even on the mountain at all.
Maybe when the weather got
bad, they retrace their steps
and went back out the way they hiked in.
Or perhaps they hustled down
to the rendezvous point early
and continued on before
the valley group arrived.
But then again, maybe not.
The uncertainty of it all
weighs heavily on them,
especially Natalia.
On the second night, she
dreams about her mother.
In this dream, Lyudmila
speaks directly to her,
telling her that she can't
get off the mountain.
Natalia wakes in shock
and has difficulty sleeping
the rest of the night.
Thoughts and fears about her
mother's safety keep her awake.
She tries to tell herself
that she's just being silly,
that her mother's group is so late
simply because Lyudmila is being
cautious about the weather.
But after 48 hours, these excuses
ring more and more hollow.
At breakfast, she tells
Konstantin about her dream.
She pleads with him to go back
up the mountain and search.
It is a grade three hike after all,
and they don't need special gear.
Konstantin is sympathetic to her concerns,
but reminds her that they
only have enough supplies
for their full trek.
They don't want to double
back in search of Lyudmila
only to run out of food and
put their own hikers at risk.
He's reassuring, firm, a
good leader like her mother.
And so she accepts his reasoning.
They're skilled hikers, sure,
but they're not a professional
search and rescue team.
Soon after, they reach
their final destination,
a small town on the shores
of the enormous Lake Baikal,
but a cloud hangs over their arrival
because there's no sign of
Lyudmila's group here either.
Natalia is beside herself now.
They came together.
The two groups were
supposed to leave together.
Lyudmila even has train
tickets for the whole group.
Natalia doesn't know what to do.
She's always looked up to
her mother for strength,
confidence, and this uncertain
danger has no easy solution.
Konstantin's eyes return to the high peaks
looming in the distance.
He begins to fear that he's
made a terrible decision
that'll haunt him for
the rest of his life.
"What on earth," he wonders,
"is happening up on the mountain?"
(wind whooshing)
The night of August 4th.
On the peak,
Lyudmila and her students
aren't getting any sleep.
In the early morning hours,
one of the students from the boy's tent
trudges over to Lyudmila's tent.
It's Sacha, an inexperienced
23-year-old hiker.
He's like a surrogate son to Lyudmila.
He tells her that the
boys are uncomfortable.
The wind and the calms
are too much to bear.
At this elevation, there's no tree cover,
no protection from the storm.
Their tents are no match
for the relentless wind.
At four in the morning, the tethers snap.
Everyone scrambles out
into the bitter cold,
struggling to resecure their shelters.
Snow seeps into the tents,
soaking through the sleeping bags.
It's a miserable, punishing night.
Finally, at dawn, Lyudmila
tells them it's time to go.
They must descend immediately.
After a quick breakfast of Cannes stew,
the group begins hiking back
down the mountain to the south.
While they're still roughly
following their planned route,
they've abandoned any
attempt to summit the peak
and instead seek protection
from the severe weather
2.5 miles below where there's tree cover.
The heavy winds continue,
making it difficult to progress.
Visibility is dismal.
Then suddenly, at about
11:00 a.m., Sacha falls down.
The other hikers help him to his feet,
but soon he collapses again.
He's starting to fall behind.
Lyudmila hangs back to help him,
telling the other hikers to go ahead.
She and Sacha will catch up.
The five other students comply,
grabbing onto each other
to stabilize themselves against the wind.
Like a phalanx of Roman soldiers,
they make their way
slowly and deliberately
down the mountain.
They're making progress
and the tree line is
beginning to feel achievable.
But soon, they hear Lyudmila's voice
shouting from behind them.
She's screaming for help.
Leaving the phalanx,
17-year-old Valentina rushes
back to help their leader.
She arrives to find Lyudmila
crouched by Sacha's body, despondent.
The young man who had
been complaining of cold
mere hours before isn't moving.
Valentina looks closer
and she sees that his eyes are vacant,
staring off into the distance.
Sacha is dead.
(somber music)
Overcome with shock,
Valentina is momentarily
unable to speak or breathe.
It feels like she's
stumbled into a nightmare,
but the nightmare is only beginning
because a moment later,
Lyudmila collapses as well.
The other students see her go down
and panic sweeps through
the group like a wildfire.
The failings breaks.
Valentina looks on in
terror as chaos breaks out.
Everyone is screaming, flailing,
but not because they're afraid.
They're all in pain.
Valentina's fellow students
are bleeding from their ears,
eyes, and noses.
They're foaming at the mouth.
This doesn't make sense.
None of it makes sense.
A couple of them are tearing
at their clothes frantically,
madly.
Valentina has never seen anything like it.
And suddenly, to her shock,
more of them begin to collapse
to the ground one by one.
Valentina tries to pull
Viktoriya to her feet
only for the girl to rabidly
bites Valentina's hand.
She tries again,
pulling the convulsing girl
down the mountain with her.
They're only able to make
it to a few more steps.
Before Viktoriya fights free
again, but she doesn't go far.
She falls to the ground and stops moving.
Valentina keeps going.
Maybe if she makes it to
a nearby cluster of rocks,
maybe then she'll be
safe from this madness.
But when she nears the rocks, she halts,
stopped in her tracks by yet
another terrifying sight.
One of the other girls,
Tatiana, is already at the rocks
and is bashing her own head against them
over and over again.
A curtain of blood obscures
her face from view.
Tatiana keeps smashing
her head into these rocks
until eventually, she stops moving.
Valentina is frozen, paralyzed
by complete shock and panic.
In the span of minutes
and with zero warning,
her entire group has dropped dead.
Suddenly, a hand shoves Valentina,
shaking her out of her stupor.
Someone is still alive.
It's one of the boys, Denis.
He's on his hands and knees,
bleeding from the ears and mouth,
yet he's able to muster up enough energy
to give her one single command, run.
(suspenseful music)
This shocks Valentina into action.
She bolts downhill,
making for the tree line.
Behind her, Denis tries to crawl after,
but he has no strength.
She glances over her shoulder
to make sure he's following,
yet he isn't.
He's lying face flat in the
snow, completely immobile.
By now, it's just Valentina.
Overcome with fear and a
burning desire to survive,
she advances downhill
through the swirling wind
and blinding snow, stumbling,
crawling, before at last,
she finally reaches the tree line
and a shelter from the wind.
She digs a sleeping
bag out of her backpack
and crawls inside.
She huddles into a bowl for
warmth before she passes out.
A day later, the weather subsides.
Valentina wakes up on
August 6th and it's quiet.
No screams, no howling wind,
just the gentle rustling of trees
and the drip, drip, drip
of the melting snow.
She cautiously emerges
from her sleeping bag.
The sun is out.
Even though she slept for almost 24 hours,
she doesn't feel rested.
The horrific sights from the day before
are clear in her mind's eye.
She wishes that she could
dismiss it as a nightmare,
something caused by a lack
of sleep or exhaustion,
but she knows the truth.
She can't kid herself.
She's alone.
(somber music)
Valentina slowly starts to
trudge back up the mountain.
She's gotta see her fellow hikers.
She needs to have some
sense of what happened.
Before too long, the
bodies come into sight.
A cluster of four of them by the rocks
and too farther up the slope.
They're all still and silent.
Steeling herself, Valentina
walks from body to body.
She can't do anything for them
now besides close their eyes.
She passes Tatiana, the
24-year-old secretary,
the one who smashed her face
into the rocks not long ago.
She passes the small body of Timur
who was only 15-years-old.
He was the youngest of the group.
Viktoriya was also there.
Valentina couldn't help,
but feel some kinship with the other girl,
only a year younger than her.
She had been so eager to hike
that she had her parents persuade Lyudmila
to let her join them
even though she was an
inexperienced hiker.
It breaks her heart to see Denis,
the boy who saved her, lying on the slope.
If he hadn't told her to run,
she might've died there as well.
Once she's closed all their eyes,
Valentina does her best
to cover the bodies
with one of the tents.
She gathers whatever supplies
she can from their packs.
Food, Lyudmila's map, and a compass.
But as it turns out, the map
and compass are of little use
because Valentina is lost.
(ambient music)
The snow drifts make it impossible
to follow the path that
Lyudmila planned for them.
They were less than halfway
through the 40 kilometer route,
and Valentina doesn't wanna risk
hiking over the snowy peak alone.
Instead, she decides to head back down
in the general direction
their group climbed up.
She needs to get to a
more reasonable altitude
as soon as possible.
As she continues her descent,
a promising sight greets her eyes.
Thin cables running above the treetops,
power lines, which run to the nearby peak
of the mountain.
Making her choice, she continues walking,
her eye on the power lines,
trusting that they'll show
her the way to safety.
After all, when there's power,
there's bound to be civilization.
Even though it's entirely
downhill, it's an arduous journey.
Her supplies were thin fast.
She eats a dried golden root
forged by the group several days before.
It's rich in minerals and keeps her going.
Her home feels impossibly far away
in these desolate mountains,
yet one thought pushes Valentina forward.
The thought of her home
back in Kazakhstan,
the thought of her family
who entrusted Lyudmila
to bring their little Valia home safe.
Valentina has to survive
to see them again.
She travels from tower to tower,
pausing to catch her
breath, but never stopping.
She tracks for four
days, growing delirious.
And one fortunate night, she
finds a winter hut unlocked.
She collapses inside,
grateful for the shelter,
but she's on her feet the next day,
determined not to die
alone in the mountains.
She doesn't notice when
she catches the colds,
when she can feel a
fever eating away at her
and has to pause every so often
to allow herself to cough.
At lower altitude, there is less snow.
But aside from the cabin, she
hasn't seen any civilization,
not a town or even an outpost.
Because of this, doubts
begin to eat away at her.
Perhaps she should have tried
to retrace her group's footsteps instead,
back to the town they started out from.
Finally, Valentina reaches a river.
This gives her some hope.
Many of the rivers in the
area flow from Lake Baikal,
which is where they start in their trip.
She follows the rocky shore,
heading upstream in hopes
that someone will see her.
And eventually, by the
grace of God, someone does.
(somber music)
On August 9th, 1993, tourists
from Ukraine cross her path.
One of the tourists, Alexander Kvitnitsky,
sees her and swims to her side.
Valentina has done the impossible.
She survived.
When she's rescued, she's incoherent
and is only able to give local police
a scattered account of what happened.
Nevertheless, while Valentina
is sent home to her family,
a search efforts mounted
to find the bodies of her companions.
And what rescuers find defies
explanation even to this day.
(somber music)
(propellers whirring)
August 24th, 1993,
helicopters fly over the peak
of the Khamar-Daban mountain range.
They've been searching for weeks,
trying to locate the
missing group of hikers
from Kazakhstan.
Finally, someone sees something
and the helicopters descend.
They found the summit
group's final campsite,
and with this, the bodies.
The snow around the peak has melted,
revealing a gruesome sight.
After 19 days of exposure to the elements,
their bodies are in poor condition.
The tent that Valentina draped over them
couldn't prevent them from rotting.
None of the bodies have eyes
and worms thrive in their empty sockets.
With increased visibility on the mountain,
rescuers are able to
see that the hikers died
only a few hundred feet
shorts of Titran's Peak.
A wooden tower is indeed there,
which would've protected
them against the elements
far better than a flimsy tent
on the side of a mountain.
Why Lyudmila hadn't
fought to get there safely
puzzles the search party,
even as they gather the
unfortunate victims.
More puzzling is the fact that they find
only a single can of stew by the campsite.
Nothing else, no other food,
not even a candy bar wrapper.
It's this evidence that seems to indicate
that this group was under fed
and needlessly exposed to the elements.
They zip up the bodies and bags
and load them onto the helicopter.
The smell is unbearable
as they take them back to be autopsied.
The bodies are found
to be protein-deficient
and malnourished.
The leader of the search
party, Yuri Golius,
has seen enough.
The can of stew, the hazardous
placement of their campsite.
To him, it's no mystery
what happened to these kids
on the mountain and he
knows exactly who to blame,
Lyudmila herself.
(somber music)
Yuri is familiar with Lyudmila
and has long believed that
she mistreated her students.
Based on his previous encounters with her,
Yuri claims that she often
pushed her teenage students
to their limits, including
underfeeding them
and not providing them
with proper clothing
for the elements.
In Yuri's mind, there's no doubt
that Lyudmila's poor leadership
contributed to the deaths
of the group at Khamar-Daban.
Even further,
he claimed that he wouldn't
put it past Lyudmila
to choose a poor campsite
in order to, quote,
"toughen her students up."
But even still, not everyone
agrees with Yuri's assertion.
Valentina, after years of silence
in the wake of this horrific event,
spoke out in support of Lyudmila Korovina.
She claims that the
summit group was well fed
and cared for throughout the hike,
and that Lyudmila knew
that there were hikers
of varying experience,
and so she planned for a
diet of 2,400 calories a day.
The official cause of
death for the five students
is listed as hypothermia.
As for Lyudmila herself,
it's believed that she
died of a heart attack
upon seeing Sacha die before her eyes.
But the details of the event itself
defies such an easy conclusion.
For instance, why was
Valentina able to survive
if all of them were in the
same state of malnutrition
and exposure?
How was she, a 17-year-old girl,
able to outlast an experienced mountaineer
and her own peers?
And most of all, why did their
deaths happen so suddenly
and within such close proximity?
Satisfactory answers
unfortunately remain elusive.
However, as it stands,
the facts are these.
Six healthy individuals died very suddenly
in close proximity to each other.
All of them displayed strange,
unexplained symptoms
in their final moments
that included self-harm,
bleeding from the ears, eyes, or throat,
and sudden debilitating pain.
All of these details come
from Valentina herself
who describes the experience
like a horror movie.
Now, hypothermia could
explain some of the symptoms
Valentina noticed,
such as the attempts
to frantically disrobe.
This is a phenomenon known
as paradoxical undressing.
In extreme cold weather, a
person's blood vessels constrict
to save heat.
As hypothermia sets in,
the constriction of these
blood vessels fails,
causing warm blood to flood
back into the extremities,
making someone feel
like they're overheating
even as they literally freeze to death.
People in this state frequently
tear off items of clothing,
only hastening their own demise.
But smashing your own head into rocks,
sudden inexplicable bleeding,
neither of these are
symptoms of hypothermia,
nor should they be contagious
in the way that they seem to
be among Lyudmila's group.
Another theory is that
these hikers suffered
from altitude sickness,
which can trigger any
number of adverse effects
in the human body.
Among these can be pulmonary edema,
a buildup of fluid in the lungs,
which can trigger heart
palpitations and bloody coughing.
Perhaps it could have been
something they aimed or drank.
The strange behavior
that Valentina witnessed
could have been caused
by a poisonous plant
that the others had consumed
and she had fortunately avoided
or perhaps contaminated
water was the culprit.
Lake Baikal is known for
high levels of contamination,
and if hikers filled their water bottles
from one of its river, they
could have poisoned themselves
without even knowing it.
In the pursuit of truth,
curious researchers have turned away
from the direct events of the hike
and towards increasingly
elaborate conspiracy theories.
The most dramatic of these
is that these hikers were
unwitting participants
in a Russian weapons test,
victims of some nerve agent
that got unleashed under
the cover of the storm.
Novichok chemicals, for instance,
were developed in the late
stages of the Cold War
by the Soviet Union.
Phosphorus based and
designed to be undetectable,
they cause disorientation, as
well as foaming at the mouth
and can be administered in aerosol form.
A similar, if slightly outlandish theory,
assumes that the sudden hysteria
and death among the group
was caused by infrasound.
The term infrasound refers
to low level frequencies
that can occur naturally,
emitted by geophysical phenomena.
These sounds, while
non-audible to the human ear,
can be felt by the
cochlear in the inner ear,
causing extreme discomfort.
In certain extreme conditions,
infrasound has been known
to cause sudden sickness
and even death.
At certain frequencies,
it's theorized that these sounds
could cause the internal
organs of someone to vibrate,
causing internal damage.
But even still, what could
have caused these sounds?
Why would they have affected
only six of the seven hikers?
Every single theory
inevitably runs up against
the central question
of this entire incident.
How did Valentina survive?
When a journalist asks her
how she managed to live
when the others didn't,
her answer is simple.
She was in very good physical condition.
She lived on a farm her whole life
and was used to high altitude
and strenuous exercise,
but this description
could apply to any one
of the hikers present.
Even the youngest member of the group,
15-year-old Timur was an
experienced outdoorsman.
The only hiker with
questionable experience
was the 16-year-old Viktoriya
who had previously suffered
from fatigue on easy hikes.
There just has to be something missing,
some detail that got lost in
the noise of Valentina's trauma
and the punishing weather.
But if there is a key
that helps us understand
what happened at Khamar-Daban,
it seems unfortunately to
have been irretrievably lost.
Like the dead, the
mountain keeps its secrets.
And if there's one thing to
take away from all of this,
their campsites will
forever hold a mystery.
